ArchSchema description
======================

Â 
ArchSchema plots the relationships between Pfam domain architectures. An
architecture is defined as the sequence of Pfam domains common to a
family of protein sequences. On the plot each architecture is
represented by a node with the domains colour-coded, as shown in the
examples below.

b. ![](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/archschema/gif/eg_node2.gif)
c. ![](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/archschema/gif/eg_node3.gif)

The red underlines in (c) indicate the extent to which 3D structures of
the domains and architectures are available in the PDB. Left-clicking on
a node shows a panel containing information about the constituent
domains, the protein sequences having the given architecture, and any
sequences that have whole or partial structures in the PDB.

You can display protein sequence (or, alternatively, the protein
structures) associated with each architecture, as in the examples below.
Where there are too many sequence or structure nodes to show, a
selection are shown and are colour pink (as in the third example).
