\section{Discussion}
% The discussion should examine in detail the significance of results and place them in the context of other published work. You should not reiterate your results. Any failings or shortcomings of the project should be identified. In this section consideration of the greater significance of the results should be demonstrated. An outline of what follow up work could be carried out may be useful (i.e. future work).
% 
% \begin{itemize}
