\section*{Abstract}
\setcounter{page}{2}

\subsection*{Background}
% The abstract or summary should contain an outline of the work carried out and any significant results achieved. 
% \begin{itemize}
 % \item Is abstract between 200-300 words?
 % \item Does the abstract describe the nature of the work and the results obtained?
 % \item The abstract should contain key-words.
% \end{itemize}
% 
% The Abstract provides the reader with a summary of the contents of the dissertation. It should therefore be brief but contain sufficient detail, telling the reader the motivation for the work; project objectives; techniques employed; main results and conclusions. Abstracts should not normally exceed a page and should be self-contained.
% 
% The Abstract is the "gateway" to the contents of the dissertation, and therefore it is important that the Abstract gives the reader a good initial impression. Try to write Abstract with a "punchy" style.
% 
% (Write the Abstract last. The dissertation will be easier to summarise once all the bits are in place.)
